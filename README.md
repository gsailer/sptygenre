# SptyGenre
Analyse spotify playlists for generes.
The genres are displayed in a wordcloud plot.
Code works but is still "alpha" so use with precaution.
For installation make sure python is installed and install dependencies by:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

You can run
	./analyzeGenres [spotify playlist uri]
